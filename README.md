This project is about creating a Python program that generates a diamond-shaped pattern of asterisks (*) based on a specified number of rows (numRows). The input is provided through the command line, and the program adjusts the diamond shape depending on whether numRows is even or odd. Additionally, the program counts and displays the total number of asterisks printed in the pattern.
